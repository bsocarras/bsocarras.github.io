        This picture is one I took just before starting school at Northwestern.
        This image was supposed to be the one on my wildcard, but it appears I submitted
        it incorrectly. Man, I am really bad at smiling for a camera.
    </p>
    <p>If you click on the picture, you'll have the pleasure of seeing another
        stupid picture of me, this time permanantly displayed on my wildcard.
    </p>
    <p>Things I have learned at Northwestern:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are a lot of rich people in the world</li>
        <li>Being smart and good at school isn't enough, I have to do something amazing</li>
        <li>To be talented here means you're really fucking good at it</li>
        <li>There are in fact people who think like I do</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, you can do some really cool things though. Most of my professors have ridiculous backgounds</p>
