        This picture is one I took just before starting school at Northwestern.
        This image was supposed to be the one on my wildcard, but it appears I submitted
        it incorrectly. Man, I am really bad at smiling for a camera.
    </p>
    <p>If you click on the picture, you'll have the pleasure of seeing another
        stupid picture of me, this one permanantly displayed on my wildcard.
    </p>
    <p>Things I have learned at Northwestern:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Being smart and good at school isn't enough,
            to stand out you have to do something amazing
        </li>
        <li>To be talented at something here means you're really fucking good at that thing</li>
        <li>I thought I knew how to work hard.. then I got to college</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The school schedule's really fucked up; we start in late September and get out in mid-June.
        This means that the only companies we can intern for during the summer are those that accomodate our odd
        schedule.
